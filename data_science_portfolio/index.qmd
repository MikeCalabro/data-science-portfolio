I teach math and statistics at St. Sebastian's in Needham, MA. I also serve as the school's Head Varsity Baseball Coach, and as the Defensive Coordinator of the Varsity Football Team.

Recently, I have rekindled my passion for data analysis. Specifically, I love uncovering insights from all sorts of data sets using the R programming language and the tidyverse framework. The purpose of this portfolio is to share my insights with whoever may stumble across it.

Thanks for checking it out... I hope you enjoy!
